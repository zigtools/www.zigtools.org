In-Editor Config (a.k.a workspace configuration) will integrate with the config system of your editor to configure ZLS on a per-editor basis. Most editors also support per-project configuration.

\* Only a subset of config options are available.

## Available Config Options

Most editors do not know which config options are available for a language server like ZLS. ZLS provides a [JSON Schema](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/blob/master/schema.json) that can be used to find all available config options.

Be aware that configuration options change over time. The linked schema file above assumes that you are using ZLS nightly/master. When using a tagged release of ZLS, use the JSON Schema file corresponding to that version, like so:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zigtools/zls/refs/tags/<ZLS_VERSION_HERE>/schema.json
```
