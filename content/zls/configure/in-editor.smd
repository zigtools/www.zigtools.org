In-Editor Config (or Workspace Config) will integrate with the config system of you editor to configure ZLS on a per-editor basis. 

Some editors (like VS Code) also allow workspace-specific configuration. If you want to share the same configuration across multiple editors, please refer to the [zls.json]($link.page('zls/configure/zls-json')) alternative.

\*\*\* In-Editor configuration is somewhat tedious to setup for this Editor. You may favor the [zls.json]($link.page('zls/configure/zls-json')) alternative.
