## Build Options

Run `zig build --help` in the root of the ZLS source directory to print usage information.

Here are some of the common build options:

- `-Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`
- `-Dtarget`
- `-Dcpu=baseline` (opposite of `-march=native`)
- `--prefix`

## Resolve version string

When compiling a tagged release of ZLS, the version is hard coded. No further action is needed.

For development builds, the version string is determined by running `git -C . describe --match "*.*.*" --tags` and formatting the output as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev.COMMIT_HEIGHT+SHORT_COMMIT_HASH` (e.g. `0.14.0-dev.365+6a16b27`). If the version cannot be resolved, it defaults to `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev` (e.g. `0.14.0-dev`). This logic is implemented in the `getVersion` function within `build.zig`.

If building ZLS without access to Git metadata (e.g., from a shallow clone or tarball), it is recommended to manually specify the version string using the `-Dversion-string` build option.

## Dependency fetching

ZLS uses the Zig's builtin package manager to fetch dependencies and compile them from source. By default, Zig stores dependencies in the global cache directory at `$(zig env | jq -r .global_cache_dir)/p`, where each dependency is uniquely identified by a hash of its content.

The content after building ZLS may look similar to this:

```bash
$ tree $(zig env | jq -r .global_cache_dir)/p
```

If you need to fetch dependencies in a separate phase (e.g. during the configure phase), use `--system [pkgdir]` to disable automatic package fetching and manually specify the directory containing the fetched dependencies. Dependency hashes and URLs can be found in the `build.zig.zon` file.
