ZLS can be configured to build your project on save. If that results in errors, they will be displayed in your editor like any other diagnostic.

## Configuration

There are two ways to opt into Build-On-Save:

- The `build.zig` of your project defines a "check" step. (**recommended**)
- The `enable_build_on_save` config option has been manually set to `true`.

The first method avoids dealing with config options and can report compile errors quicker.

### Add a "check" step to your build.zig

This part is more deeply tied to your specific project but the gist is the following: whatever you do to define your main executable or library, you do it again in a new step named check.

I'll use for this example the executable definition step you get generated automatically from `zig init`.

```zig
// Create a module just like in the `zig init` template.
const exe_mod = b.addModule("foo", .{
    .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
// Any other code to define dependencies would probably be here.

// Create an executable from the given module.
// Still the same as the `zig init` template.
const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
    .name = "foo",
    .root_module = exe_mod,
});
b.installArtifact(exe);

// This is where the interesting part begins.
// As you can see we are re-defining the same executable but
// we're binding it to a dedicated build step.
const exe_check = b.addExecutable(.{
    .name = "foo",
    .root_module = exe_mod,
});
// There is no `b.installArtifact(exe_check);` here.

// Finally we add the "check" step which will be detected
// by ZLS and automatically enable Build-On-Save.
// If you copy this into your `build.zig`, make sure to rename 'foo'
const check = b.step("check", "Check if foo compiles");
check.dependOn(&exe_check.step);
```

The most important part about this second executable definition is that we ask to build it, **but we never install it**. If you look at the final line of the first section, you will see that we call `b.installArtifact` on the original executable, but for the executable bound to the "check" step, we don't.

This one-line difference will have a big impact on the resulting behavior of the build as it will add the `-fno-emit-bin` flag to the compiler invocation which, in other words, means that Zig will analyze your code (and report any error) but it won't bother calling into LLVM since you don't plan to install the executable anyway.

The result is that you will get diagnostics pretty fast since you won't have to go through the “LLVM Emit Code…” phase.

Once you're done with this, restart your editor (or at least ZLS), **save your file with an error in it**, and enjoy your new spiffy diagnostics.

### Customize build arguments

By default, ZLS will try to run the equivalent of the following command:

```
zig build check --watch
```

If no "check" step has been found and `enable_build_on_save` has been enabled, it will fall back to the "install" step.

To further customize the build arguments, the `build_on_save_args` config option can be used. Here are some arbitrary examples to showcase what could be done in theory:

- Override which build step(s) should be run: `"build_on_save_args": ["check", "test"]`
- Set project-specific build options: `"build_on_save_args": ["-Dtarget=wasm32-wasi"]`
- Set additional build system flags: `"build_on_save_args": ["-j4"]`

Run `zig build --help` to find out what build steps and build options are available in your project. 

### Incremental Compilation (experimental)

As of [Zig 0.15.x](https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.1/release-notes.html#toc-Incremental-Compilation), incremental compilation is still under active development:

> Zig 0.15.x makes further progress on the work-in-progress Incremental Compilation functionality, which allows the compiler to perform very fast rebuilds by only re-compiling code which has changed. Various bugs have been fixed, particularly relating to changing file imports.
>
> This feature is still experimental—it has known bugs and can lead to miscompilations or incorrect compile errors. However, it is now stable enough to be used reliably in combination with `-fno-emit-bin`.

Because the previously mentioned "check" step only reports compile errors without emitting code, it integrates well with incremental compilation:

To try it out:
  - Ensure that your project defines a "check" step
  - Do **not** enable the `enable_build_on_save` config option
  - Set `"build_on_save_args": ["-fincremental"]`

Restart ZLS and review the [log output](/zls/guides/view-logs) to ensure there are no errors and that the config options were applied correctly. At this point, compile errors should appear *almost* instantly as you make changes.
