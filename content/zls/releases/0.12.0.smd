## Feature improvements 

### New Type Hints ([#1444](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1444)) ([#1512](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1512)) ([#1778](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1778))

```=html
<!-- thank you @Koranir and @nullptrdev -->
```

New inlay hints have been added for variable declarations, captured values and struct literal fields.

```=html
<!--
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const Pair = struct { lhs: u32, rhs: u32 };
    const paerchen = [2]Pair{
        .{ .lhs = 7, .rhs = 42 },
        .{ .lhs = 66, .rhs = 3 },
    };
    for (paerchen, 0..) |pair, i| {
        std.debug.print("{d}: {}\n", .{ i, pair.lhs < pair.rhs });
    }
}
-->
```

![new type hints](new-type-hints.png)

These new inlay hints can be separately configured with the following new config options:

- `inlay_hints_show_parameter_name`
- `inlay_hints_show_variable_type_hints`
- `inlay_hints_show_struct_literal_field_type`

### Build on Save ([#1361](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1361))

The new `enable_build_on_save` config option enables ZLS compile your project with `zig build` and report back diagnostics.

![new build on save](new-build-on-save.png)

You can control which build step should be executed with the `build_on_save_step` config option which defaults to the "install" step.

Please be aware that the [vscode-zig](https://github.com/ziglang/vscode-zig) extension provides a similar feature through the `zig.buildOnSave` config option.

### Completions

#### highlight symbols that call `@compileError` as deprecated ([#1764](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1764))

Any symbol that calls `@compileError` will marked as deprecated in completions, hover and semantic highlighting. Different editors/clients may represent this information differently (or not at all).

![completions on compile error](completions-on-compile-error.png)

The error message does not need to start with "Deprecated;".

##### Semantic highlighting of deprecated symbols in VS Code

Most Color Themes in VS Code do not visualize deprecated tokens. The following setting can be used in VS Code to highlight deprecated tokens with a <s>strikethrough</s>.

```json
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
  "rules": {
    "*.deprecated": {
      "strikethrough": true
    },
  }
},
```

#### Detail field to pointer deref and optional unwrap operations ([#1745](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1745))

Completions of the `.*` and `.?` operations will now show the result type.

![completions on an optional](completions-on-an-optional.png)
![completions on a single item pointer](completions-on-a-single-item-pointer.png)

#### Filesystem completion in build files ([#1668](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1668))

While editing a `build.zig` file, you will now receive filesystem completions inside string literals when typing a valid file path.

![filesystem completions in build.zig](filesystem-completions.png)

#### Module completions for `std` and `builtin` ([#1656](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1656))

Completions inside an `@import` will include the `std` and `builtin` module with their file path. (#1656)

![std module completion](std-module-completion.png)

#### completions with 'replace' instead of 'insert' ([#1458](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1458))

| Editor/Client    | Config Option                      | Default Value |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| VS Code          | `editor.suggest.insertMode`        | `"insert"`    |
| Sublime Text LSP | `completion_insert_mode`           | `"insert"`    |
| Helix            | `completion_replace`               | `false`       |
| Emacs lsp-mode   | `lsp-completion-default-behaviour` | `:replace`    |

A config option in Vim/Neovim depends on the LSP or completion plugin being used.


```=html
<!-- https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kate/-/blob/master/addons/lspclient/lspclientcompletion.cpp -->
```

Kate Editor has a config option for this feature `Configure` -> `Editing` -> `Auto Completion` -> `Auto word completion` -> `Remove tail on complete` but it does not use ZLS.

#### completions for function aliases with self parameters ([#1656](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1656))

```=html
<!-- thank you @nolanderc -->
```

Declarations to function alias that take a self parameter are now included when providing completions on member access.

The following example would previously not give any completions.

```=html
<!--
const Foo = struct {
    const alias = func;
};

fn func(self: Foo, number: u32) void {}

test {
    var foo: Foo = undefined;
    foo.
}
-->
```

![completions on function alias](completions-on-function-alias.png)

### Snippets

Snippets for float and int types have been removed. ([#1681](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1681))

There are new snippets that add top level declaration for `std`, `@import` and `std_options` ([#1498](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1498)) ([#1830](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1830))

### Configuration

#### validate configuration options ([#1366](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1366))

The config system has been revamped to validate config options like executable or directory paths and provide better diagnostics.

![error messages on bad config](error-messages-on-bad-config.png)

When your editor does not support displaying a message window, you will still find them in [ZLS's log output](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/wiki/Guide:-How-to-view-ZLS-log-output).

#### ZLS+Zig compatibility check ([#1808](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1808))

ZLS has the following compatibility requirements:

- A tagged release of Zig or ZLS must be used with the same tagged release of Zig or ZLS
- A master/nightly build of ZLS requires master/nightly build of Zig

As of right now, a master/nightly build of ZLS does try to be _mostly_ usable with the latest tagged release of Zig but this is done as a best effort and is subject to change. ([#1020](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1020))

When your ZLS and Zig version are incompatible, ZLS will show you a warning:

![ZLS 0.12.0 being used with Zig 0.12.0-dev](zls-0-12-0-being-used-with-zig-0-12-0-dev.png)
![ZLS 0.12.0 being used with Zig 0.11.0](zls-0-12-0-being-used-with-zig-0-11-0.png)

When your editor does not support displaying a message window, you will still find them in [ZLS's log output](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/wiki/Guide:-How-to-view-ZLS-log-output).

#### autofix disabled by default

```=html
<!-- @Techatrix **sad autofix noises** -->
```

The autofix feature is now disabled by default. ([#1657](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1657))

##### removed `enable_ast_check_diagnostics`

Getting quickly informed about compile errors while coding is a vital feature that has little reason to be disabled.

##### removed `enable_import_embedfile_argument_completions`

This feature has been unstable in the past which is no longer the case.

##### removed `include_at_in_builtins`

This options served as a workaround for an issue with builtin completions in Sublime Text 3 which has been resolved.

##### removed `max_detail_length`

This options served as a workaround for an issue with long completion detail entries bricking the preview window in Sublime Text ([#261](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/261)) which can automatically be set by querying which editor/client is being used.

### Performance

```=html
<!-- thank you @SuperAuguste -->
```

The [DocumentScope](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/blob/master/src/DocumentScope.zig) is an internal datastructure of ZLS that keeps track of variables, declarations and their scopes. Most analysis relies on it to perform symbol lookups, iterate symbols or quickly traverse scopes. Every time a document is modified, the DocumentScope is rebuilt for the entire document so it has been rewritten with Data-oriented design principles in mind to reduce its performance footprint. ([#1517](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/pull/1517))

Here is a benchmark where the DocumentScope is constructed and deinitialized 100 times on Zig's [Sema.zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/src/Sema.zig):

```
