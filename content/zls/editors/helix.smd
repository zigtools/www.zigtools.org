If `zls` and `zig` are in your `PATH`, everything should work out of the box.

To apply in-editor configuration or manually specify the path to `zig` or `zls`, open `<config_dir>/helix/languages.toml` and add the following:

```toml
[language-server.zls]
# omit the following line if `zls` is in your PATH
command = "/path/to/zls_executable"
# There are two ways to set config options:
#   - edit your `zls.json` that applies to any editor that uses ZLS
#   - set in-editor config options with the `config.<name>` fields below.
#
# Further information on how to configure ZLS:
# https://zigtools.org/zls/configure/

# Whether to enable build-on-save diagnostics
#
# Further information about build-on save:
# https://zigtools.org/zls/guides/build-on-save/
# config.enable_build_on_save = true

# omit the following line if `zig` is in your PATH
config.zig_exe_path = "/path/to/zig_executable"
```

Further information on [languages.toml files](https://docs.helix-editor.com/languages.html#languagestoml-files).

To make sure that Zig and ZLS are set up as expected you should run the Helix health check:

```
hx --health zig
```

For more information on the health check results refer to [Health check](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Healthcheck).

## Code Actions on save

Helix does not yet support running code actions on save. See [helix-editor/helix#1565](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/1565).

## Per-project config

Helix allows setting LSP settings per project via a `./helix/config.toml` file. For more information, check the Helix [configuration docs](https://docs.helix-editor.com/configuration.html). 

If the use case for per-project config is to set the path to the Zig or ZLS executable, consider using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to add it to your `$PATH` or use a version manager for Zig and ZLS.
