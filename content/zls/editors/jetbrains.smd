- Install the [ZigBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22456-zigbrains) plugin from the marketplace
- Restart the IDE (necessary for the plugin to integrate itself correctly)

If you have both `zig` and `zls` in your `PATH`, then the plugin should automatically detect both.

If not, Go to `Settings` -> `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Zig`, and point the `Toolchain Location` and `ZLS path` to the zig compiler's directory and the ZLS executable, respectively.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a "Zig Language Server" in the `Language Servers` Tool Window in the left margin.
