Install [kakoune-lsp](https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp).
Make sure `zig` and `kak-lsp` are in your `PATH`.

To enable lsp on start add the following to `<config_dir>/kak/kakrc`
```sh
eval %sh{kak-lsp}
lsp-enable
```

You will probably want to add additional recommended keybindings found [here](https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp/blob/master/README.asciidoc#configure-key-mappings).
