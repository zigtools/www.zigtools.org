The following LSP plugins are documented:

- [nvim-lspconfig](/zls/editors/vim/nvim-lspconfig) (recommended for Neovim users)
- [CoC](/zls/editors/vim/coc)
- [YouCompleteMe](/zls/editors/vim/ycm)

>## [Warning]($block.attrs('warning'))
>
>The [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) package manager can only install the latest tagged release of ZLS which should **not** be used with Zig nightly/master.

For neovim users who want to use nightly zls, you can install [`jinzhongjia/zig-lamp`](https://github.com/jinzhongjia/zig-lamp), which can install zls nightly through a simple command and parse `build.zig.zon`, add or remove dependency.
